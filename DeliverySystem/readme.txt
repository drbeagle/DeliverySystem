Project Title: DeliverySystem

This project is setup to test a theoretical delivery system. Hard coded values are used within the MainWindow class. 
The UI is only built to show a van and a truck along with their delivery schedule. The total travel time for that vehicle
is displayed at the bottom. This is a very simple example of how the DeliverySystem might work.
